#Printing_patterns_with loops

Using looping concept pattern is printed and whole code is written in main function.
Six loops are used for printing pattern.
Loops can be reduced.

#Bitwise_Operator

In this program bitwise "AND(&)",bitwise "OR(|)" and bitwise "XOR(^)" functions are used and practiced.

#SmallTriangles_LargeTriangles

In this program triangles are  sorted according to the size of perimeter where all sides of triangles are given.And then printed again sides of triangle in sorted way according to the perimeter.

#Boxes_through_tunnel

You are transporting some boxes through a tunnel, where each box is a parallelepiped, and is characterized by its length, width and height.

The height of the tunnel 41 feet and the width can be assumed to be infinite. A box can be carried through the tunnel only if its height is strictly less than the tunnel's height. Find the volume of each box that can be successfully transported to the other end of the tunnel. Note: Boxes cannot be rotated.
Code is written in C.

#calculate_nth_term

Code for calculating nth term is given.

#student_sum_solution

A tricky twist is given in question.Logical problem statement and its solution done in C.
